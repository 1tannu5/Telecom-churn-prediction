# Telecom-churn-prediction
The telecom churn dataset was analyzed to predict customer churn using a Random Forest classifier. The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and encode categorical data. After splitting the data into training and testing sets and scaling the features, the model achieved an accuracy of [accuracy score], indicating good performance. The confusion matrix showed [TP] true positives, [TN] true negatives, [FP] false positives, and [FN] false negatives, highlighting areas for potential improvement. Key predictors of churn were identified through feature importance analysis, helping to target customer retention efforts effectively. Visualizations, including a correlation heatmap, target distribution, and ROC curve, provided clear insights into feature relationships and model performance. This analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting customer churn, offering valuable insights to reduce churn rates and improve customer satisfaction.
